# Advent Calendar Theme

This application was created to serve as a reusable advent calendar for students to have a new activity to complete every day. Its currently set up for Mod 1 students at Turing to have HTML, CSS and JavaScript exercises to work on during winter break. 

## To use this theme:
* Fork the repo
* Edit the `box-details` file in `data.` It set up to pull links and emojis from there. You can add any number of boxes, but 12 works best.
